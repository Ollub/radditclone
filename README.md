Pet project used to pump my Go skills
inspired by https://github.com/d11z/asperitas


Original project was written with NodeJS + React.
My goal was to replace NodeJS backend with Go-based.

## Technology stack
1. Standard http package + gorilla router.
2. Custom generic-based schema validation with govalidator.
3. Clean architecture.
4. PostgresQL + pgx for storing users.
5. Redis for sessions.
6. MongoDB for posts.
7. testing + httptest + testify + gomock + go-sqlmock for testing.
